For anyone out in the wild, please note the following things:

1. Our swerve drive uses dual NEOs along with CTRE Absolute Mag Encoders for movement and odometry.
2. PathPlanner is configured for this drivetrain, make sure to change default settings, speeds, ratios, and ports for PathPlanner and Constants to match your robot.
3. I think that's it? If you have questions, ask mmmspicy. on Discord.
